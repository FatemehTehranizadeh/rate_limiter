# Rate Limiter (Go)

A concurrency-safe and high-performance rate-limiting library written in pure Go.  
It implements multiple algorithms like Token Bucket, Leaky Bucket, and Sliding Window.

## ðŸš€ Project Goals
- Practice advanced concurrency (sync.Mutex, sync.Cond, sync.Pool, etc.)
- Learn struct design and interface patterns
- Prepare for REST API and microservices development
